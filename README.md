This is my thesis work, called "2-axis solar tracker system with IOT connectivity":
Here is the documentation of the project (in spanish)

All the coding was in C++ and done by me using Arduino IDE. In hindsight i know that was fully functional but the code could be improved and optimized.

Anyways, we did achieve a score of 10!

Key concepts:

• Arduino / C++

• ESP8266 WiFi

• OpenWeatherMap API

• Postman, API parsing, JSON

• Step-by-Step PWM motor control

• DC-AC converter (inverter)
